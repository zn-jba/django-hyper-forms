 <body>
  <p>The service we're creating is used for TODO lists. Implement the <code class="java">post</code> method for adding new tasks.</p> 
  <p>The next task is passed in the request body with the key "<em>todo</em>". Add this task if it's not already present in the <code class="java">all_todos</code> list.</p> 
  <p>Another key passed in the body is "<em>important</em>". Its value can be "<em>true</em>" or "<em>false</em>". If the task is important, add it at the beginning of the list; if it's not, put it in the end.</p> 
  <p>The response should be a redirection to the "<em>/</em>" page.</p>
