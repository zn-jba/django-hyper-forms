 <body>
  <p>Imagine you helped organize a conference and printed everyone's name badges. People's names and surnames are stored in different variables. However, you confused the first name and the surname of one of the guests.</p> 
  <p>To correct the mistake, you need to swap the values of the variables <code class="java">name</code> and <code class="java">surname</code>. Write a part of code to do that and remember that Python allows you to swap two variables without a third one.</p>
